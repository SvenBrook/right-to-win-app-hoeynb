The app should adhere to specific scoring rules and return numerical scores, a final RTW percentage score, and a concise narrative summary in a strict JSON format. The app should use British English and avoid buzzwords.\n\nHere's a vision for the first version of the app:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Assessment Input Screen:** A clear and intuitive screen where users can input answers to the gate and secondary questions for each of the 4Cs. The questions should be displayed in a logical order, and the input fields should be appropriate for the question type (e.g., Yes/No switches for gate questions, number inputs for secondary questions).\n-   **Scoring Engine:** The core functionality of the app, which calculates the scores for each C, the final RTW score, and generates a narrative summary based on the input data and scoring rules.\n-   **Results Display Screen:** A screen that presents the calculated scores for each C, the final RTW percentage score, and the concise narrative summary in a clear and visually appealing format. The JSON output can be displayed here as well.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light grey)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark grey)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium grey)\n    *   Primary: `#3F51B5` (Indigo)\n    *   Secondary: `#E91E63` (Pink)\n    *   Accent: `#FF4081` (Bright Pink)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFD54F` (Yellow)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n\nNow, I need to create a plan to implement this.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create the basic UI structure:** Create the screens for inputting assessment data and displaying results.\n2.  **Implement the scoring logic:** Implement the scoring rules in the app to calculate the scores based on user input.\n3.  **Implement the JSON output:** Make sure the app can output the results in the specified JSON format.\n4.  **Implement the narrative summary generation:** Implement the logic to generate a concise narrative summary based on the assessment results.\n5.  **Remove the modalDemos array:** Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nI will now call the `read_file_tree` tool to understand the project structure.\n"}, {"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I have the file tree.

Now let me create a summary document explaining what has been implemented:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented the OpenAI API integration for generating AI insights with ImpactWon's Right-to-Win methodology. Here's what has been completed:\n\n### \u2705 What's Been Implemented\n\n**1. Supabase Edge Function (`generate-rtw-insights`)**\n- Deployed and active Edge Function that calls OpenAI's GPT-4o API\n- Constructs detailed prompts based on ImpactWon's 4C methodology\n- Provides structured insights with:\n  - Executive Summary\n  - Strengths & Weaknesses analysis\n  - Critical Focus Area identification\n  - 4-5 Recommended Actions\n  - Risk Assessment\n- Proper error handling and logging\n- CORS support for cross-origin requests\n\n**2. Enhanced Results Screen (`app/results.tsx`)**\n- Beautiful visual representation of 4C scores with color-coded circles\n- \"Generate AI Insights\" button with loading states\n- Automatic saving of assessments and insights to database\n- Score labels (Strong/Moderate/Needs Attention)\n- Improved user feedback with alerts\n- Disabled state during loading to prevent duplicate requests\n\n**3. Improved Insights Screen (`app/insights.tsx`)**\n- Clean, readable display of AI-generated insights\n- Formatted sections for better readability\n- Robot emoji icon for AI branding\n- Navigation options (back to results or start new assessment)\n- Loading states and error handling\n\n**4. Custom React Hook (`hooks/useRTWInsights.ts`)**\n- Reusable hook for generating insights\n- State management (loading, error, insights)\n- Clean API with `generateInsights()` and `reset()` methods\n- Comprehensive error handling and logging\n\n**5. Database Integration**\n- Automatic saving of deals to `deals` table\n- Automatic saving of assessments to `rtw_assessments` table\n- AI insights stored with each assessment\n- Proper foreign key relationships\n\n**6. Documentation (`docs/openai-integration.md`)**\n- Comprehensive guide covering:\n  - How the integration works\n  - Technical implementation details\n  - Security considerations\n  - Cost information\n  - Troubleshooting guide\n  - Best practices\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Key Features\n\n- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses GPT-4o for intelligent insights\n- **ImpactWon Methodology**: Follows CEO-Led Sales 4C model precisely\n- **British English**: All insights use British English as specified\n- **Actionable Recommendations**: Provides specific, measurable next steps\n- **Data Persistence**: Saves all assessments and insights to database\n- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages\n- **Loading States**: Clear visual feedback during API calls\n- **Security**: API keys stored securely as environment variables\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Technical Stack\n\n- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4o model for text generation\n- **Supabase Edge Functions**: Serverless backend for API calls\n- **React Native**: Mobile app framework\n- **TypeScript**: Type-safe code\n- **Expo Router**: Navigation\n\n### \ud83d\udcca Scoring Logic\n\nThe system correctly implements the ImpactWon scoring rules:\n- **Credibility** = Knowledge \u00d7 Trust (capped at 5 if gate question fails)\n- **Capability** = Competence \u00d7 Quantum (capped at 5 if gate question fails)\n- **Commitment** = Outcome \u00d7 Satisfaction (0 if gate question fails)\n- **Control** = Mastery \u00d7 Influence (capped at 5 if gate question fails)\n- **RTW Score** = Average of all 4Cs\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 How to Use\n\n1. Complete a Right-to-Win assessment\n2. View results on the Results screen\n3. Click \"\ud83e\udd16 Generate AI Insights\"\n4. Wait 3-10 seconds for AI analysis\n5. View personalized recommendations on the Insights screen\n6. All data is automatically saved to the database\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Configuration Required\n\nMake sure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set in your Supabase project:\n1. Go to Supabase Dashboard\n2. Navigate to Edge Functions \u2192 Secrets\n3. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Benefits\n\n- **Time-Saving**: Instant analysis instead of manual review\n- **Consistency**: AI applies methodology consistently\n- **Actionable**: Specific recommendations for improvement\n- **Learning**: Helps users understand the 4C model better\n- **Data-Driven**: Based on actual assessment scores\n\nThe implementation is complete, tested, and ready to use!
